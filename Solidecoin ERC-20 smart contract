/* Note from Honore Herbert: The supply mechanisim of the ERC20 token comes in different flavors
   from a preset minter role to a pauser role the mint function is preferably used
   to make the smart contract extendable as we do not know how it could  be used in the future .
   this ER-20 smart contract was written on the openzeppellin guidelines. The smart contract is
   crosschain capable with the inputing of a token bridge in creating a crosschain capability
   (moving assets from one chain to the other) this smart contract was audited by our patners from
   Uhuru Labs a smart contract commisioning technology lab all smartcontracts are tested on the
   ropsten testnet as it is almost the same as the ethereum mainnet.
   The solidecoin token exist in the testnet for testing and research purposes only
   you can search for the contract with the smart contract address 0xc00B456AC643B4D8d8C4dBa741710E8eE3bAD516
   with just two adresses having the token.
   This smart contract first block was formed November 2021.
   Another token on the testnet called amacoin was minted June 2022 with the contract address.
   0xF5BfD138bC489010FFe7D212f6f0F7Cd389561B6  the solidecoin token uses same smart contract used
   on ropsten on this  project annd the only thing changed is the name and the ticker symbol the reason for
   this is to avoid the project being blocksquatted.
   It should be of note the safe maths smart contract is not used as it is has depreciated on solidity
   8 because there is no need to check for integer overflows on the latest solidity versions. There are no
   safe maths codes to cater for interger calculations on the ERC-20. The lastest codes on solidity is safe
   are safe from interger overflows.
   The solidecoin token still uses the 18 decimals as it has not been overridden*/

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
